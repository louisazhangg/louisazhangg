### Hi! I'm Louisa 🙂👋

### ⭐️ About Me:

📍 Sophomore in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
♟️ Played competitive chess for 8 years— always down for a game!  
💖 Been doing boxing for the past couple years, catch me there Saturday mornings! 

Interested in using software to solve practical problems and make an impact. I love working on projects where I can build something useful while picking up new skills along the way! **Feel free to reach out with any opportunities or just to chat on my LinkedIn! 😊**
